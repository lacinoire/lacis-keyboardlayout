# Lacis Keyboardlayout
The self-designed keyboard layout I currently use.

Optimized for easing Japanese Input with Romaji (vocals at baseline, consonants not used in japanese at more incovenient places than those used).

Convenient layout of special characters + numbers for programming (easy access to brackets and lower numbers (more often used) ).

German Umlauts in Alt-Space, rest of Alt-&Shift-Alt Space filled with Unicode emoji (trying to place them at letters which are useful for memonics.

Deadkey next to the Backspace: used to access greek letters, math symbols & arrows.

Further Dead keys for accents and polish special characters.
